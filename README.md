# Recipe Images Exporter

Automatically generates recipe images for all recipes that are loaded into the game, including recipes from mods and data packs.

To use this mod:
1. simply install it as normal
2. open Minecraft
3. load a world
4. enter chat command `/export-recipe-images` and hit Enter.

You will get chat feedback from the mod on export progress.

Once complete, in your Minecraft game directory there will be a "recipe-images-exporter" directory, and the exported recipe images will be in there.
